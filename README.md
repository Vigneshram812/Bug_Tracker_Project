# Bug Tracker Project

This project demonstrates a simple bug tracking system using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The data entered into the system can be saved into an Excel file for further analysis and record-keeping. The project uses the SheetJS (xlsx) library to handle the creation and downloading of the Excel files.

## Purpose and Usefulness

This project is valuable for business/product analysts to track, organize, and store the status of bugs effectively. It enhances efficiency in managing bug information, ensuring that all relevant details are captured and can be easily exported for reporting and analysis.
